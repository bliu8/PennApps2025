### API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "notification": {
    "title": "Don't let your milk go to waste!",
    "body": "Your milk expires in 2 days. Use it in coffee, smoothies, or make pancakes today!",
    "priority": "high",
    "suggested_actions": [

}
```

## How It Works

1. **Query Database**: Finds items expiring within 10 days
2. **Filter Urgent Items**: Prioritizes items expiring in 3 days or less
3. **Format for AI**: Structures data for Gemini processing
4. **Generate Content**: Uses AI to create personalized notifications
5. **Display Results**: Shows notification in terminal or returns via API

## Configuration

Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key

## Demo Usage

For hackathon demos, you can:

1. Add some test inventory items with expiry dates
2. Run the terminal command to see live notifications
3. Use the API endpoints for mobile app integration
4. Customize the notification prompts in `notification_service.py`

## Integration with Existing System

This system integrates with your existing:
- ‚úÖ MongoDB database and inventory items
- ‚úÖ Authentication system (Auth0)
- ‚úÖ Gemini AI service
- ‚úÖ Repository patterns

The notification system respects your existing data models and follows the same patterns as other services in the codebase.
