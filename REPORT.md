# Leftys Mobile MVP — Implementation Report

## Overview
- Replaced the Expo starter screens with a behaviorally informed Leftys experience built around packaged-food sharing.
- Added reusable UI building blocks (surface cards, pills, metric tiles, post cards) and a refined color system for a calm, trust-first interface.
- Seeded representative demo data for postings, pickup prompts, impact metrics, and allergen filters to showcase the core flows without external APIs.

## Behavioral Nudges
- **Default choices:** Highlighted 30-minute pickup windows, preset reminders, and public handoff locations as easy one-tap defaults that align with community norms.
- **Social proof & impact framing:** Surface live metrics (“Neighbors helped”, “Quick pickup streak”) and social context on each post to reinforce positive habits.
- **Salience & simplification:** Grouped safety guardrails and allergen filters inside lightweight cards so the right actions are obvious without cognitive overload.

## Screen Highlights
- **Today tab:** Personalized greeting, hero prompt, quick action cards, impact metrics, curated open postings, and safety callouts.
- **Discover tab:** Map-style preview with approximate pins, smart filters, planning guidance, and trending postings list.
- **Safety modal:** Condenses trust & safety policies into digestible cards with a closing action to return to the main flow.

## Implementation Notes
- All strings reference sealed, packaged food per policy. Exact map coordinates remain abstract until claim acceptance.
- Components avoid runtime network calls and keep placeholders where a backend, storage, or push service would eventually connect.
- Design tokens live in `constants/theme.ts`; data scaffolding is in `constants/mock-data.ts` to keep content centralized.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Wire components to live API endpoints once available (auth, postings, claims, analytics).
- Add persistence for user preferences (allergen filters, reminder settings).
- Layer in push notifications and location services with environment-driven API keys when credentials are provisioned.
